This is an _alpha_ version of a GJTAPI TPI which supports
voice capable modems. There is an implementation for the
Hayes Accura V92 external modem, supporting other modems
should be straightforward.

What you need to have to use it:
    1) A voice capable modem which you know works.
    2) JTAPI/GJTAPI (JAIN Jcc optional)
    3) This code
    4) Java 1.4.1
    5) Java Comm

I've modified the net.sourceforge.gjtapi.test.TestMediaCall so
that it uses a Provider specified on the command line.

I've only used it on RedHat 7.2 with Sun JDK 1.4.1 and
    the JavaComm from IBM.

Caveats:
   1) It is untested I've played with it, but nothing more - we 
          felt it was better to let it out early and let people
          play with it.
   2) I have only used it on a Hayes Accura V92 External modem.
   3) There is some attempt at catching errors but there are still
          places where it just prints to stderr.

How to use it:
   Compile the lot.
   edit the Modem.props file in the base directory to describe the device you have, and
      the telephone numbers you have.
