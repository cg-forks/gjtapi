 * This method imposes or removes load control on calls made to the specified addresses.
The implementation can throw the MethodNotSupportedException if the platform does not support the load control
functionality. Note that a policy object may be designed to define the policy to be implemented by the platform as a result
of this method instead of defining the policy through the given parameters. This might be designed in the future
specifications.

 * @param duration specifies the duration in milliseconds for which the load control should be set. Duration of 0 indicates that the load control should be removed. Duration of -1 indicates an infinite duration (i.e until disabled by the application). Duration of -2 indicates network default duration.
 * @param admissionRate the call admission rate of the call load control mechanism used.
 * @param interval the type of call load control mechanism to use, the interval (in milliseconds) between calls that are admitted.
