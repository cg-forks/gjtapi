/**
 * These are the methods required by TelephonyProviders that support object "throttling" for JTAPI.
 * 
 * Throttling attempts to reduce the amount of information the service provider
 * has to report about calls by telling it when information is needed on calls.
 * So, for instance, I can tell the service provider that I want all call
 * information reported on certain addresses or terminals, so that if a call
 * exists, the GJTAPI layer will start receiving event notifications about it
 * and can track it's state.
 * 
 * If the user actively creates a call, this call object now exists in GJTAPI
 * and needs event notification when the call's state changes.
 * CoreTpi.createCall(...) implicitly says that events must be reported for
 * the call until GJTAPI says it doesn't need state information anymore
 * (which is when all handles to the Call have been dropped and the object is
 * being gc'd from the weak map), since GJTAPI has an object for the Call that
 * needs its state information synchronized. At this point, GJTAPI issues a
 * TrottleTpi.stopReportingCall(CallId) message.
 * 
 * The other time that a service provider should start reporting events on a
 * call is when TrottleTpi.getCall(CallId) is called. In this case, a Call
 * object is being re-constituted and GJTAPI needs its current state information.
 * 
 * So, basically, start reporting events on Calls when "CoreTpi.createCall(...)"
 * or "TrottleTpi.getCall(CallId)" is called and stop when
 * "ThrottleTpi.stopReportingCall(CallId)" is called.
 * 
 * Note that the CallId lifecycle may be different than the Call object, since
 * GJTAPI keeps a weak map from CallIds to Calls so that it can reconstitute
 * them when needed.
 *
