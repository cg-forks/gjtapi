This is an _alpha_ version of a GJTAPI TPI which supports
Dialogic (an Intel company)'s GlobalCall API.

What you need to have to use it:
    1) A working Dialogic configuration. There is no point in
trying to use it if the Dialogic GlobalCall demos don't work.
    2) JTAPI/JAIN/GJTAPI 
    3) This code
    4) Java 1.41
    6) gcc(linux) or VC 6.0(Windows) to build the shared library

I've updated the net.sourceforge.gjtapi.test.TestCallListener so
that it takes a provider as an argument. It also waits 'till
the user hits return so as to allow the call to go through all
its phases.


I've only used it on RedHat 7.2 and WindowsNT with DNA 5.1 

Caveats:
   1) it doesn't do media -yet- I need a week or two to get that
implemented - when I'll find it I have no clue.
   2) it is untested I've played with it, but nothing more - we 
felt it was better to let it out early and let people play with it.
   3) I have only used it on a D/300, so I may have made some ISDN
assumption.
   4) Allmost all the failure modes are un-caught, and just result in
text to stdout - we need to make that smarter.
   5) My ISDN supplier doesn't bind telephone numbers to channels,
so the provider reports all numbers on all terminals (and vica versa)

How to use it:
   Compile the lot.
   edit the DialogicGC.props file to describe the Dialogic
devices you have, and the telephone numbers you have.
   In net/sourceforge/gjtapi/raw/dialogic/native:
      Edit the makefile to reflect your paths
(Vc++ users you'll have to make your own project)
      Make the .so
      edit the testjtcall script to reflect your numbers
      run it.

We've included a dll and a .so in the 'binary' release so 
people can play without needing to build the source.
