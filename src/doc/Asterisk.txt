This is a quick overview over the Asterisk-Provider.





The asteriskprovider currently supports calling and detecting incoming and outgoing calls as
well as conference and transfer through join().
getAddresses() lists all available SIP phones. To use another phone add "Phone=phonename"
(e.g. Phone=ZAP/4) to Asterisk.props or to the providername.



To get it working adjust the Asterisk.props or use
"Asterisk; Server=IP-Addresse; Port=Port; User=ManagerUsername; 
Password=ManagerUserPassword; Context=AsteriskContext" as providername. 
(e.g. "Asterisk; Server=192.168.0.1; Port=5038; User=user; Password=1234; Context=default;
ConferenceContext=custom-meetme")

For conference and transfer you must have a special context for the meetme application and you
have to specify that context in the Asterisk.props or within the providerstring.
e.g.:
[custom-meetme]
exten => _X.,1,MeetMe(${EXTEN},dqx)

Conference and transfer doesn't work with a bristuffed asterisk because of a bug in it. There is
a patch for bristuff but it didn't solve the problem for me.



Beside that asteriskProvider needs 'asterisk-java-0.2.jar'.
