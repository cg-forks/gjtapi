<h2>
<a NAME="Background"></a>Background</h2>

<blockquote>JTAPI is a broad-based Java Telephony API designed to be able
to adapt to any call model.&nbsp; As such, it is characterized by its wealth
of optional capabilities (capabilities and extensions) and by the resulting
complexity.&nbsp; The Generic JTAPI framework is an attempt to build a
re-usable core for JTAPI implementations.&nbsp; To accomplish this, the
Generic JTAPI framework limits its scope to a commonly used subset of JTAPI
functionality.&nbsp; It also exposes a simplified "service provider interface",
known as the Telephony Provider Interface, that simplifies the building
of implementations and allows for implementations to be plugged together
in arbitrary ways.
<p>JCC is a call control model designed to support a much more narrowly
defined role, that of call control in integrated networks.&nbsp; As such,
it borrows much of the flavour of JTAPI and marries it with the industry-standard
"Parlay Call Control Service" specification.&nbsp; Parlay is language neutral
and is defined at the IDL level for both CORBA and Microsoft distributed
environments.&nbsp; Unlike JTAPI, JCC does not contain optional behaviour
through capabilities and extensions, although it still allows for "MethodNotSupportedException"s.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="Generic JTAPI - JCC Mapping"></a>Generic JTAPI - JCC Mapping</h2>

<blockquote>Using the Generic JTAPI Framework as a basis for JCC support,
we need to determine how JCC call model objects could be mapped to GJTAPI,
what new functionality would be needed by GJTAPI and if there is any opportunity
for simplifying the SPI required to write JCC-compliant adapters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h3>
<a NAME="Application Provider Interface"></a>Application Provider Interface</h3>
The following table maps the Generic JTAPI classes to the corresponding
Jcc classes and outlines what new functionality would be required by the
core to support Jcc.&nbsp; Note that Jcp objects all extend Jcp (Java call
processing) objects which correspond closely to JTAPI objects.
<p>In general, all Jcp and Jcc calls through exceptions that parallel the
JTAPI exception but, of course, have a different package.&nbsp; So, for
instance, JccProvider.createCall() throws jain.jcp.InvalidStateException,
whereas JTAPI's Provider.createCall() throws javax.telephony.InvalidStateException.&nbsp;
Since these are both classes, and Java does not support multiple inheritance
for classes, we cannot simply defined a common subclass that supports both
and simply throw this.&nbsp; Instead, some sort of exception morphing will
have to occur.

<h3>
<a NAME="Service Provider Interface"></a>Service Provider Interface</h3>
The following changes to the TelephonyProvider Interface are suggested
by a preliminary view of the API mapping:
<ol>
<li>
Addition of CallLoad support methods</li>

<li>
Addition of Address type interrogation</li>

<li>
Addition of support for Call and Connection routing and processing</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="Suggested Work"></a>Suggested Work</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Add defined functionality to the four affected Generic JTAPI objects</li>

<li>
Create wrapper subclasses for Provider, Call and Connection that delegate
off calls but morph thrown exceptions into the proper type.</li>

<li>
Add tracking of Jcp listeners to the ListenerManager so that it can create
the appropriate event types.</li>

<li>
Add event filtering to the ListenerManager</li>

<li>
Add support for LoadControl to the framework</li>

<li>
Add support for Address typing to the framework</li>

<li>
Add support for Call and Connection routing and processing to the framework</li>

<li>
Map the Jcc media handling to the framework's media objects.</li>

<li>
Add new methods to support the TelephonyProvider changes outlined in the
previous section.</li>

<li>
Create JTAPI and Jcc 'abstract" TelephonyProviders that optionally allows
providers to be written for just one usage of the framework without the
other usage's method's being exposed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a NAME="Open Issues"></a>Open Issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Since terminal's are not supported by Jcc, we may have problems mapping
accept() and media calls to the framework's commands.&nbsp; The framework
could delegate these calls to a single terminal or throw an exception if
the terminal is ambiguous.</li>

<li>
Since the current Generic JTAPI framework bases call answering and media
access on terminals, providing these services to service providers that
don't define media terminals may be problematic.&nbsp; One option is to
force them to define dummy terminals; another is to augment or change the
TPI mapping for these functions.</li>

<li>
Currently the Generic JTAPI framework relies on listening to all tracked
calls to ensure that its call state is synchronized with that of the low-level
TelephonyProvider.&nbsp; If lazy tracking is employed, the framework only
requests call information of calls that applications have shown interest
in.&nbsp; None-the-less, this may not scale to JAIN levels and may require
an even further loosening of the current lazy call mapping.</li>

<li>
While Jcc adds these new capabilities, it also simplifies other JTAPI requirements.&nbsp;
So, do we require:</li>

<ul>
<li>
That all low-level TelephonyProviders support all existing Generic JTAPI
and Jcc capabilities?</li>

<li>
Provider abstract classes that allow JTAPI-based and Jcc-based providers
to be build without requiring them to know about the functionality required
by the other subset.</li>

<li>
Try not to plug Jcc into the Generic JTAPI Framework, but rather fork off
a new framework tailored specifically to Jcc requirements?&nbsp; The disadvantage
of this is loosing low-level TelephonyProvider re-usablility and maintenance
issues as bugs are now duplicated across two code sets.</li>
</ul>
