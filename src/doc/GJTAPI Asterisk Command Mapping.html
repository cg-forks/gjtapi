<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
This document serves as a basic architecture and design document for
mapping the GJTAPI Service Provider interface into available Asterisk
API calls and protocols. The intention is to provide full JTAPI support
for the Asterisk open-source VoIP PBX under the X11 open-source
licence. In addition JAIN JCC and JAIN Jcat support will also be
forthcoming.<br>
<br>
In the spirit of releasing early and gathering developer interest and
support, the development of the Asterisk GJTAPI service provider will
proceed from basic capabilities to more advanced functions. For the
first major milestone, only basic JTAPI support will be provided.<br>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>History</h2>
GJTAPI is an open-source Java Telephony framework that supports three
Java telephony standards:<br>
<ol>
  <li>JTAPI. Currently JTAPI 1.3.1 is supported, although a branch to
support JTAPI 1.4 has had a significant amount of work done on it.</li>
  <li>JAIN JCC 2.1. This is a JCP JSR that supports basic call control
functionality targetted at the network telephony providers</li>
  <li>JAIN JCAT. This is a JCP JSR for providing coordination and
transaction control of telephony calls (such as applications invoked on
calls), targetted at the network telephony providers.</li>
</ol>
In order to support the three standards as well as the multiple
packages within JTAPI itself (GJTAPI supports base, callcontrol, media
(1.2 and 1.3) and privatedata), while simplifying the development of
the GJTAPI service providers, GJTAPI defines a hierarchy of interfaces
that a service provider may implement. So, for instance, implementing
the interface "BasicJtapiTpi" provides enough functionality to support
the core JTAPI package.<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The purpose of this document is to outline how GJTAPI service provider
methods and events will be mapped to Asterisk protocols such as IAX,
FastAGI and ManagerAPI. It is intended to be a living document and to
take input from developers as they develop certain components.<br>

<h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Implement BasicJtapiTpi. This allows us to set up the provider,
register listeners, create calls, release calls, get Addresses and get
Terminals.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Implement CCTpi. Provides support for <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Hold, Unhold and Join</span>.</li>
  <li>Implement MediaTpi. Supports <span style="font-weight: bold;">playing
sounds, recording sounds, generating signals, retrieving signals</span>.</li>
  <li>JccTpi. Support <span style="font-weight: bold;">JAIN JCC</span></li>
  <li>JcatTpi. Supports basic Jcc requirements of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">beeping, attaching media, setting load
control, getting address types and getting dialled digits.</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>ThrottleTpi. Supports Jcat requirements of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">suspending and reconnecting calls,
registering and unregistering addresses, and managing terminal text.<br>
    </span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Domain Models</h2>
What do an Address, Terminal and Call map to in Asterisk<br>
<h3>Address</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This is probably fairly trivial. It is
just a number that can be associated with an Asterisk end-point.<br>
</div>
<h3>Terminal</h3>
<h3>Call</h3>
<h2>Service Provider Mappings</h2>
<h3>Step 1<br>
</h3>
To start, we need to support five things:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Initialization. Do we use initialize(Map) entries to define which
Asterisk machine to connect to, with user name and password?<br>
  </li>
  <li>getAddresses(). How do we find all the Addresses in the Asterisk
Domain?</li>
  <li>getTerminals().</li>
  <li>reserveCallId() and createCall(). How do we instantiate and place
a new call?<br>
  </li>
  <li>answerCall(). How do we tell a call to be answered? What does
this mean?<br>
  </li>
  <li>release(). Can we shut down the leg of a call? Using what API?<br>
  </li>
  <li>Monitor events and event translation. How do we track a call's
state. It would be nice to get caller id information as well.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
